        "description": "Reem obtained her PhD in Biotechnology from the University of Manchester under the supervision of Prof. Mark Ashe and Prof. Chris Grant. During her PhD and a subsequent postdoc in Mark Ashe's lab she engineered S. cerevisiae strains to produce butanol by introducing the ABE pathway from bacteria into yeast, applying metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies to enhance butanol production, and continued that work as a research associate in Mark Ashe's lab. Reem joined the lab of Prof. Patrick Cai in 2018 as a postdoctoral research associate. Reem is currently working on Sc3.0 project and genome minimization via SCRaMbLE. She is constructing and characterizing artificial new essential chromosome in the Sc2.0 synthetic strain. In her free time, she enjoys working as a volunteer in different charities. Reem loves reading, painting, cooking, travelling and exploring life.",

She joined the group of Professor Patrick Cai in 2019 as a master student and, after her graduation with a Molecular Biotechnology MSci from University of Pisa, she started her PhD. Her work involves the engineering of the next generation of tRNA neochromosomes. She believes that the tRNA neochromosome research within the Sc2.0 project is a highly fascinating research field which will allow observation towards de novo chromosome building but also to study fundamentals of tRNA biology which would not be accessible in a standard biological system. In her free time, she volunteers in science research events, she enjoys travel, reading, going to the cinema and loves good food.",

He did his PhD at the University of Potsdam, Germany under the supervision of Professor Katja Arndt, focussing on synthetic systems for directed evolution and transcriptional regulation in E. coli. He is working on biocontainment in synthetic biology, developing genetic systems to contain engineered organisms to defined culture conditions. In his spare time, Stefan enjoys kickboxing, gardening, DIYing and a variety of outdoor activities.",

His work involves using CRISPR and adeno-associated virus (AAV) to develop tools for rewriting human genomes. These will allow analysis of the functionalities of genetic sequences at a previously unattained resolution. This project is in collaboration with the Chew Lab (Genome Institute of Singapore). Outside of the lab, Josh enjoys travel, SCUBA diving and climbing.",

He performed his PhD at the University Aix-Marseille, France, under the supervision of Prof. Jean-Paul Bourdineaud and Dr. Christelle Adam-Guillermin, aiming at integrating the epigenetic response in the field of radioecotoxicology. He then joined in 2017 the research team lead by Dr. Jean-Paul di Rago, France, to work on the nuclear relocation of mitochondrial genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.[br]His current research aims at implementing a fully synthetic, size-reduced and functional mitochondrial genome in S. cerevisiae by removing the presumably non-essential inter- and intragenic sequences, representing more than 80% of the mitochondrial genome size. Kewin truly believes that mitochondria play a central role in eukaryotic cell’s adaptive capabilities and evolution.[br]In his spare time, Kewin enjoys learning about psychology, playing guitar and cooking.",
